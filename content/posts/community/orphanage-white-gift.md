For December 6th during GE10 class, each group was assigned to bring materials for a white gift donation to the Sto.  Nino Orphanage. So, each person brought as much of what they could for the donations, including canned goods, toiletries, biscuits, and more. Some of us also brought art materials for the designing of the box. As for me, I brought a box of soaps, toiletries, biscuits, wrapping paper, and some shoe boxes to pack the gifts into. My other group member, Juano, brought a larger box for everything to fit into. It truly was a group effort.

We each contributed to the white gift making and divided up into partners. Two of my group members were assigned to the card making, while the rest of us packed and designed the box. The wrapping paper I brought was not enough, since I wasn't anticipating the size of the box actually. Thankfully, my other groupmate brought a huge pack of construction paper, so I thought of a patch-like design for the wrapping, and my other groupmates thought of making snowflakes. In the end, we ended up having a really, really, really colorful gift box full of color and fun.

I was not expecting the turn out of my group's white gift. It was a very fun and collaborative moment for my group-- a somehow perfect way to end the semester with them. We also heard that our group's gift ended up being a favorite for the kids, so it was a happy surprise. I felt quite happy preparing the gift. One of the harder parts, however was figuring out how to carry the box actually, since the box was heavy and we didn't cover the bottom with wrapping at all. It still turned out alright though. My favorite part was the decorating of the box. We worked in pairs taping the construction papers to each side. It was also fun cutting out snowflakes and trying different designs.

In the end, it was an overall satisfying experience. We got to give to those less fortunate than us, in hopes to really brighten up a kid's day. I hope that in the future, maybe with other organizations since this group is temporary, I will be able to give more white gifts and have an enjoyable time sharing the charitable Christmas spirit with others.

Because of this acitivity, I was able to spread hope to others, and I am truly grateful for the life I have.
