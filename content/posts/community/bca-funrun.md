The Rotaract Club of Dumaguete held their 2nd Breast Cancer Awareness Fun Run for a Cause on October 8th at 5:00am around Dumaguete City. It was a funrun for a good cause, raising money for breast cancer awareness. The Rotaract Club asked for a partnership with the Silliman University Camera Club as their event photographers, and so I along with many others who volunteered for SUCC documented the BCA Fun Run. Each location was assigned two to three photographers. Since I am one of the elder members of the clubs, I was the lead photographer for the location I was assigned to, since my partner was a MACRO member still in training. I was also one of leaders during the event because of my officer role in the club. Only the President, Ate Cindy, and I were present officers during the event. The rest of the members present were MACROs or senior members.

There was much I realized during the BCA Fun Run. I was stationed near Robinson's at the 10km mark with my partner, Aldrich. It was a warm and sunny morning while waiting for the 10km runners to pass by. It was heartwarming to see how many runners there were for the 10km, full of men and women of different age groups. Some of the women were wearing Breast Cancer survivor shirts as well. So many of them had smiles on their faces and some posed for pictures. It was really cute and I was glad I was able to document their 10km for them. There wasn't anything I disliked about the experience. 

I look forward to the next BCA Fun Run, since they plan for it to be an annual event. I hope they will have SUCC as partners again so that we can support the fun run's good cause. Personally, I do have family members that have or have had cancer, including my Lola who is a breast cancer survivor. In the future, I hope that I may be able to participate in the fun run itself if I am not shooting for SUCC.

Because of the Breast Cancer Awareness Fun Run, I am looking forward to shooting for more events for a good cause.
