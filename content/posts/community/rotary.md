The Rotary Club Governor’s Night took place on September 22nd at 6:00pm at Brooke’s Place. It was an event that was pretty much like a huge thank you party from the Negros Oriental & Siquijor Division to the Rotary Club Governor, Governor Twinkle. The Rotary Club commissioned the Silliman University Camera Club as their event photographers, and thankfully I was granted the opportunity to capture the event.

I learned a lot during the Governor’s Night, not only as a photographer, but also as someone outside of the Rotary Club. I have always wondered what the Rotary Club does, since I’ve heard about them, but I just never knew what they do. So, throughout the night I learned much about what they do, what they value, and so on. The Rotary members live their lives in service of the community, which is truly the Rotary Club’s purpose and spirit.

With all this in mind, I hope that one day I will be able to give back to the community and those around me some day. Getting involved in more community work is something I strive to achieve in the future, even outside of the Rotary Club activities, as that may be a huge reach. I hope that in the meantime I may be able to be of service to the Rotary Club, at least through photography and capturing moments for them.

Because of this activity, I am more inspired to do more in service of others.
