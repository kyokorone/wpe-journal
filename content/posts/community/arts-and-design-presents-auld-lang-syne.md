The SUSHS Grade 12 Arts and Design batch finally performed their musical stage play, Auld Lang Syne, and I was so excited! Not only was I able to watch as an Arts and Design ate, as I was an arts and design graduate in senior high, but I was also able to document their play for them! One of my arts and design juniors, who is also a SUCC member, commissioned me as a photographer for their play. So, on December 17th at the Woodward Theater I spent the beginning of my evening reminiscing about my arts and design days and supporting my juniors.

I realized a lot while watching and documenting Auld Lang Syne. I really loved supporting our juniors and I was so happy being able to capture everything for them. I did struggle a bit with angles, and one of the characters was difficult to capture since her costume camouflaged with the black backdrop, but it was still alright as long as the lighting was okay. Their play was definitely more comfy and quirkier than my batch’s, but it suits them!

I really had fun being able to do something for my juniors, while also capturing a play for the first time. I hope that I can document more arts and design activities in the future in support of them. Knowing that arts and design is already a small group, being able to help in whatever way I can is fun. It’s also a little thank you to them for helping us out before, as well as a thank you to my teachers, Ma’am Dolly and Ma’am Sun. I miss them all, as well as my classmates before.

Because of this event and opportunity, I am able to give back to the arts and design community and reflect on my senior high days.
