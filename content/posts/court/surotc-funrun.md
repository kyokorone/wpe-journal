On December 9th starting at 5am at the Cimafranca Ballfield, the SUROTC Unit held the Fun Run and Christmas Fellowship for the end of the first semester. During the funrun, my squad HQ-PHOTO G, was assigned to document the funrun. I was assigned to the ballfield where the fun run would begin and end. My fellow PHOTO G cadets were assigned to other places on campus, such as the nursing building, the Silliman University Church, and so on. Afterwards, there was a Christmas Fellowship held, where everyone got to have snacks. Each PHOTO G was assigned to a platoon during this time. Then, we got dismissed around 9am or 10am.

During the Fun Run, I got to learn a lot about sports photography, especially when it comes to shooting running photography on a manual lens. At the time, I was borrowing a manual 35mm lens. I was somewhat nervous since it was a manual focus lens, and I was shooting people running. However, most of the photos turned out quite clear to my surprise. I also wasn't used to 35mm, since I had only borrowed it for my shoot the night before. Despite this, I really enjoyed the 35mm. For the Fun Run itself, my least favorite part was being afraid I was in the way of the runners. I wasn't sure where to position myself, but it turned out alright.

I look forward to shooting more fun ROTC events with my fellow PHOTO G members. During the rest of the event, I got to enjoy camaraderie with my friends. Hopefully during future events, we get to play sports together, but I don't think it'll happen since we'll end up being photographers instead. Either way, I got to practice my sports photography skills.

Because of this activity, I am more experienced in sports photography!
