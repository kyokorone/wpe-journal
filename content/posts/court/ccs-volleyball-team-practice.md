On November 28th, around 3:30 in the afternoon after my section’s PE class, some of the CCS volleyball intramural team members got together for a practice session at the Rovello Field. I wasn’t really planning on joining any of the sports for intramurals this year, since I would rather be a photographer, but expect the unexpected in desperate situations, I guess.

Although I used to play volleyball almost every day at some point during the pandemic quarantine season, I can say that by some miracle I have improved a lot somehow. I am not as afraid as I used to be perhaps? But part of me wonders if it is because I am more comfortable with the people I am playing with. Anyways, I don’t really know how to spike or block still, which is a waste because of my height!

Going forward as I plan on joining the intramural games this year, apparently, I hope that I can improve much more in my volleyball skills. I hope to make my college proud perhaps, as long as I try my best during the upcoming games. Hopefully I can learn how to spike, block, receive, and so on.
Because of this odd and unexpected activity of mine, I am now looking forward to more practice sessions with my fellow CCS volleyball team members. Let’s go, CCS!
