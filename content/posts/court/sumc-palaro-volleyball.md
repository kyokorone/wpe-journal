During the Silliman University Medical Center Foundation’s Palaro, I was given the opportunity to be a commissioned photographer from the Silliman University Camera Club for their volleyball events. So, on August 1st at around 5:00PM, I went to the Foundation Preparatory Academy Gym for the game.

There was a lot that I learned at the time as a sports photographer. It was only my second time taking volleyball pictures, and it also had the added difficulty of it being indoors at night! I had expected it to be brighter, but it really isn’t with artificial lighting. This is truly a struggle when you’re only working with a kit lens, since the widest apertures you can get are f/3.5-5.6! That’s only with my camera at least. I really enjoy watching volleyball though, so I tried my best to enjoy the sport while getting my money shots.

Following my experience with this indoor sports photography shoot, I really hope that in the future I could try again with a wide prime lens. That way, I can get more light into my shots. With being able to work at a wider aperture, I’d get to work at a  higher shutter speed and avoid all the motion blur that comes with high action photography.
With this entire experience in mind, I hope I will be able to improve more in sports photography during the upcoming intramural season, given the chance.
