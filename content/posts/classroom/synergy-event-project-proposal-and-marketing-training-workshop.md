One of the most unexpected events I attended this school year was the Synergy Event seminar held by the Redshield Fraternity on October 14th, 3:00pm at the RTY Building. As I am an HQ Company Photographer cadet for ROTC this year, I was given the opportunity to be a photographer for this seminar. It was quite a simple seminar, with just the SUROTC officers and then me. The seminar was about making project proposals and marketing for said projects, as discussed by Ma’am Upi and Ma’am Pal.

I learned a lot from attending this seminar, and not just about making project proposals and marketing. Although I was initially afraid, since I was the only one not an officer in the room, like a fish out of water, I got comfortable quite quickly. I realized that most of the officers are nice. Especially Ma’am Upi and other 4th Class officers, and some of the other officers. Part of me also realized that I shouldn’t try to shoot absolutely everything, but to aim for capturing moments and what’s important. Anyways, I did learn what goes into planning events at Silliman, and I also learned about the point system, which I had no idea about.

Attending this seminar, I was quite surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. Going into the seminar as a photographer, it felt more like a chore. But leaving, I felt happy that I was able to capture the moments for the officers. Because of this event, I am more confident in my skills as a photographer for ROTC events.
