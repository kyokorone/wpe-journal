SUPASA's ENSAYO Workshop is one of my favorite memories from this first semester. I am truly grateful for the experience. The Silliman University Camera Club was invited to attend the Day 3 workshop on September 9th at  6pm in AVT, "The Art of Visual Storytelling". The guest speakers were Jomar Allen and JR Dalisay. I attended along with several other SUCC members this night and we learned so much about the art of visual storytelling, or in other terms, filmmaking.

I wasn't really expecting much for this workshop, but I was truly blown away by the lessons and talent of Kuya Jomar and Sir JR. They have so much experience in the film industry with really interesting backstories to how they got to where they are today. Kuya Jomar's talk was about unlocking your own process and style when it comes to shooting and editing. Meanwhile, Sir JR's talk was about his story and what lessons he learned from them all. During the workshop, they showed us some of their previous work, such as Kuya Jomar's advertisements for Billboard Philippines, and other big companies. Sir JR showed us some of his early day works as a "punk a** kid" from Manila, all the way to his short films made here in Dumaguete City. Some notes I took were,

"if you're not nervous, you're not growing",
"there's a thousand people who wish they were doing what you're doing",
"take a leap of faith to chase after what you love",
"once u bet ur everything, chase ur freedom",

and so much more.

This workshop is what I think back to whenever I reflect on where I am now when it comes to photography. It is what made me fall in love again with what I do as a photographer. It also inspired me to try out new things and chase growth. In the future, I hope to attend more SUPASA workshops if they have, and I hope to meet more people in the film industry like Kuya Jomar and Sir JR.

Because of the ENSAYO Workshop, I am fallen in love all over again with the art of visual storytelling.
