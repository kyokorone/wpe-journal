On December 6th, around 8am in Ausejo Hall, I attended a workshop with some of my fellow Silliman University Camera Club members. We were invited to join the workshop held by the SU CAS Psychology Department. It was a workshop about time management, which really helps as student photographers. It was a short workshop, with a short presentation, ice breakers, small groups, and snacks at the end. I attended along with my fellow SUCC members Marielle, Nicole, Kuya Vince, and Kuya Amiel.

I wasn't expecting very much from the workshop, but it kind of felt like a PEP session. We each got little booklets with some activities in them. We listened during the presentation, then filled out the activities during the groups sessions. It was surprisingly fun, as we got to look at how we manage our time currently, and we got to reflect and learn about what each other wants to be in the future. We shared about our future goals, which was really fun. The only part I didn't exactly enjoy was during the small groups by 4. It was kind of awkward since I'm not used to talking to new people, but it was still alright. At the end, everyone got snacks (pizza and drinks) from the Psych students.

Overall, it was an enjoyable time. I got to reflect on how I spend my time currently and how I could shape it to align with my future goals. I also got to enjoy my time with my fellow SUCC members and learn more about them. If the opportunity comes again, I would probably join it again and learn more about time management strategies and ask about how others manage their time.

Because of this activity, I am hopefully better at managing my time!
