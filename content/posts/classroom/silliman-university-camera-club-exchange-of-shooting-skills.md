Over the course of several months, starting August 27th until October 15th, every Sunday at 1:00pm within the Silliman campus, the Silliman University Camera Club held SUCCESS. SUCCESS, or the Silliman University Camera Club Exchange of Shooting Skills, were workshops held for SUCC members and MACROs (trainees) where experienced photographers or videographers discussed a certain skill involving photography or videography. Even though I attended SUCCESSs last year, it was still like going again for the first time, since now I am a senior member and I’ve experienced so much. I’m even the SUCC Secretary this time around, while back then I was simply a MACRO who didn’t really know anyone.

Following the thought of it all feeling new, I learned a lot about videography this time. Last year, all the SUCCESSs were focused on photography, meanwhile this year we had videography discussions every other week. I also learned and refreshed my knowledge on things that I didn’t think of much last year, such as white balance and different compositions. I also considered Kuya Urich’s thoughts on shooting in JPG a lot more, since I have grown tired of editing afterwards. And also I have a Fuji camera now, so yay. I also learned a lot about secretary and core duties this year. Truly a growing experience.

Nowadays, I have really applied what I learned. I’ve tried shooting videos this year for projects, although I still need to improve. I have also shooted more in JPG and getting everything right inside the camera. Because of all the SUCC work during the SUCCESSs, and pretty much the entire MACRO screening period, I have grown so much as a photographer and a leader. It’s humbling.
