As an ROTC HQ Photo G cadet, I was given the opportunity to be the main photographer for the Bridging Papers and Numbers seminar hosted by the Redshield Fraternity on November 15th, 6:00pm at the RTY Building Valor Room. This seminar was focused on the Redshield Fraternity’s secretariat and finance committee’s duties.

I was somewhat looking forward to this seminar, despite the busy times. I knew what to expect this time, and I also had a 4th class officer friend this time around. It was nice to see a friendly face. While documenting the event, I learned much about secretariat duties and what goes on financially during events. I was also more comfortable while shooting, since somehow it seemed like all the officers knew me this time around. It was pretty funny to me, in a good way, I’m not sure how to put it.

From this experience, I guess I can say that if I were to be a photographer for another ROTC officer event-like thing, I would be happy to do so! In a way, it’s like giving back to the officers, since I know how hard it can be at times. It is somewhat nice to be friendly with officers, surprisingly. Because of this event, I learned much more about the inner workings of secretariat and finance duties. One thing I remember from the seminar was Ma’am asking what one would do if Sir Locsin asked an officer to buy him water with the Redshield funds, and then someone said they’d buy it. It was a funny way to get her point across, but her point was pretty much just to never use the funds for external reasons, even if someone in a position of authority said so.
