This year I was invited to be a talent show judge panelist for Miller Software Development's Christmas Party on December 7th at the Garden in Claytown, Daro. How did I end up as a judge for company Christmas party though? It was impromptu actually, since I was asked to fill-in for someone. I was my friend's plus-one to the party, and I visit him at Miller sometimes, and on other occassions I have been his plus-one. So, his coworkers were familiar with me already. Anyways, Miller has a yearly talent show for the employees and they only allow people outside the company to judge, so they asked me to fill-in for someone. Other judges was the boyfriend of one of the employees, as well as someone's wife or sibling if I remember correctly.

It was my first time ever being a judge for an event, so I was somewhat nervous, but still chill. There were only 4 performances, which included two bands and two solo performances. The two bands were quite good. One of the solo performances was alright, kind of average but it was cute. The last solo performance was... a subversion of expectations to say the least. He did an impression of that infamous Taylor Lautner Jacob impression, but he only did the first part then stood still for the rest? This is why I found it hard to judge by the end. One of the scores on the rubrics was audience impact, and I simply had to give him a perfect score because of the audience. A lot of people were laughing and all. I was not sure how to score at the end, but it was still fun. I was able to learn a lot while enjoying the show.

Despite it being a unexpected opportunity, I enjoyed being a judge panelist. I did get P500 out of it after all, as a token of appreciation. Since it was my first time being a judge panelist, I still have much to learn really, although I'm not really sure what there is to learn about talent show judging? In the future, I guess I'll be less afraid of volunteering for judging if the opportunity comes by. I enjoyed attending the Miller Christmas Party overall, but being a judge for the talent show made it extra memorable.

Because of this Christmas Party, I am more comfortable taking on unexpected opportunities!
