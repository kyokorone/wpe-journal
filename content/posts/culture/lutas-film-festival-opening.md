One of my absolute highlights of this year, and probably for years to come, was given the opportunity to attend the Lutas Film Festival Opening. It was my second time dipping my toes into the Dumaguete film scene, as my first time was during the ENSAYO workshop from SUPASA. Thanks to that opportunity, Sir Jomar, a local filmmaker, invited the Silliman University Camera Club to the Lutas Film Festival Opening, which was held on October 5th, 6:00pm, at Foundation University. The moment I saw that we were invited, it was an absolute yes for me, and I was pretty much excited to attend the entire week.

The Lutas Film Festival Opening was extremely special to me. It was my first time being to anything film festival related, which has been one of my dreams ever since I fell in love with film. I was introduced to some of the Philippine film industry, such as archipelago rising. We watched some of the winning films from last year, including Itâ€™s Raining Frogs Outside, which was my favorite, Brand X, Boy Kilat, Ang Paglilikas ng Dalagang Bukid, and The River that Never Ends.

Attending the film festival really reignited my love for film and everything creative. It was really inspirational. Hopefully I will be able to attend more openings in the future, and get involved in more of the local film scene. Thanks to this event, I am definitely more driven to pursue my love for the arts and try more filmmaking.
