I think one of my biggest accomplishments this year, as well as for my photography career as a whole, was being a photographer for Ryan Cayabyab: The Maestro Returns! Last November 25th, I was the senior Silliman University Camera Club photographer during the 3:00pm showing at Luce Auditorium.

There was a lot I learned from the concert, from photography to music, which are two of my most beloved things in the world. I figured that if I were to shoot in Luce Auditorium on my own one day, that I would need either a zoom lens like my 17-85mm Canon, which has both a wide and a zoom, or I’d want two lenses, but I’m not sure what exactly, but at least a wide, such as a 25mm, and then either a 85mm prime or a telephoto zoom, such as the 50-250mm I think it was that I borrowed for the concert. Aside from all this blabber, I also learned a lot about older composers, which Mr. C centered the concert on, such as the Carpenters composers, Michael Jackson, and the LesMis composer. I truly loved the show, and I even made a Spotify playlist full of the songs they sang. No wonder my Mom loves Ryan Cayabyab. Truly a national icon.

Nowadays, thanks to the Mr. C concert, I’ve been listening to and appreciating older songs more. Not that I didn’t before, but it’s somewhat like rediscovering a different side to a loved one. I surely would love to attend another show of Ryan Cayabyab’s one day, and listen to more of his compositions. Thanks to this concert, my love for music has once again deepened.
