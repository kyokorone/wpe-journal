One of the highlights of my photography journey so far was the Imaginarium: A LibrAria Anniversary Exhibit last December 1st at 6:00pm, within the 58 EJ Blanco compound. The Silliman University Camera Club was commissioned for the event, and I was given the opportunity to be the senior photographer for the event. In a way, it was a birthday treat for myself, as my birthday was the following day. The Imaginarium exhibit was in celebration of LibrAria’s first year since opening. It was extremely cute, with a display of several book cover-like artworks made by different artists, mostly locals, but some were also from overseas.

This was by far one of the most comfortable shoots I have shot for, and still I learned a lot. It was my first time shooting with a manual 35mm prime lens, a Meike that I borrowed from someone in SUCC. I thought it would be more difficult, and it was compared to an autofocus lens, but my results surprised me! My photos were some of the best I’ve done for an event, I believe. Aside from photography, I encountered several local artists I’ve seen before, such as Sir Hersley and Ate Skye, but I met a lot more as well. I also tried kombucha for the first time, as well as other fermented drinks.

From this experience, I hope that I can continue to involve myself in the local art community and so on. The Dumaguete art culture is one full of warmth for the most part, and I hope it continues to be that way. It’s lovely seeing people come together during exhibitions, and I loved documenting it as a photographer.
Because of this experience, I am proud of myself, seeing the growth I’ve had as an event photographer. I hope I continue to grow and see more of the Dumaguete art scene.
