The Galilean Fellowship on November 21st, 5:00pm at the Silliman Church was unexpectedly memorable. I was participating with my fellow CHS classmates, more specifically my groupmates. The fellowship part inside the church was led by ates and kuyas from the Divinity School, and we discussed the UCLEM theme.

I enjoyed the fellowship and all its twists and turns. It started with all of us in the field in front of Hibbard Hall, then it started pouring, and we ended up taking cover, then eventually going to the SU Church. Once we got to our groups and chilled, the fellowship began. The theme centered around God’s GIFT, which stands for Great Incredible Favor Today.

It was a sweet message, and one of the things I remember most is how love keeps us going. If there’s anything that I hope to remember every day, it would be that. Even though it gets tiring sometimes, I want to remind people of such a message. Like how Jesus sacrificed out of love, I would also want to sacrifice myself if I must, out of love. Because of this activity, I hope to do more things out of love, and I want to remember every day that it is really love that keeps us going in life.
