One of the most memorable activities that I participated in this semester was the UCLEM Banner Making that we started making on November 17th, then finished together on November 21st. The theme was about God’s Incredible Gift for us Today, centered on John 3:16. For my group, I bought the supplies needed, and I also bought the fabric needed for our group and our partnered group.

During the activity, I learned much about what goes into making Christmas decorations and banner making. It also made me reflect on the meaning of Christmas and the Christmas spirit. One of my favorite parts of making the UCLEM Banner was my group finishing ours, and I ended up helping out my friend’s group’s banner actually. I loved helping them out.

Going forward, I hope I can take this experience and remember it going into the upcoming Christmas season. Helping out others is always a fulfilling experience, and I should do it more often. Because of this activity, I may say that I look forward to more creative group projects and helping out others in the spirit of Christmas. In theme with UCLEM, it may be my gift to those around me.
