As part of our CHS class, my group mates and I organized an outreach program for the Silliman University guards. The project planning started around the beginning of December, and it was finally executed on December 10th, around 12:00PM, around the Silliman University campus. Our outreach program included a short interview with 6 guards, then a snack consisting of a burger and a cup of matcha for each of them, as a thank you. The group that we partnered with provided the burgers, while my group provided the matcha. I made the matcha— I spent almost an hour just making the matcha to give to the guards.

During the outreach implementation, I was the documenter, taking pictures and videos of our outreach. I was able to listen to the interviews of the guards. We got to learn about the guard’s stories of how they got to where they are today, their day-to-day duties and experiences as Silliman guards, and about their faith in God. Afterwards, we said thank you by handing them their snacks, which was the most fulfilling part of the project— being able to say thanks. The matcha I made even got complimented by one of the guards, yay!

Being able to organize a simple thank you outreach for the Silliman guards was really fulfilling. Going forward, I wouldn’t mind organizing other simple outreach activities for other people who deserve it. If I could do the project again, I’d put more into the thank you gifts and give to more guards. Because of Project Exodus, I was able to get to know more about the day-to-day lives of the ones protecting us students, and I was able to say thank you and give back to them, hoping to brighten up their days.
