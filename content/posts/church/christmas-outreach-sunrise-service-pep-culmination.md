The Christmas Outreach and Sunrise Service for our PEP Culmination took place on December 6th, 5:30am, at the Amphitheater. The outreach was organized by the PEP teachers from the Guidance and Testing Division, and the rice for the outreach was donated by the PEP classes, which I am a student of. During the service, us students had the chance to be the ones to give the gifts to the guards. It was a pleasant morning service, it was my first of this kind of service as well.

During the service and outreach, I didnâ€™t understand what the Reverend was saying sometimes since she used deep Bisaya at some parts. However, I did enjoy the outreach part. We got to go to the front and hand out the rice and gifts to the guards. It was an enjoyable experience, being able to say thank you to the guards for their service.

The outreach activity and sunrise service was a morning full of thanking God for His blessings unto us, and thanking those around us for what they do. Because of this activity, I was able to reflect on the people around me and be grateful.
